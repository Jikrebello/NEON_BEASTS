## How you play Green

Green wins fights by **moving pieces**: pull enemies out of cover, drag them into Tag range, line them up for throws, and generally make the battlefield behave like a set. Your damage is fine; your real value is that you decide **where** the fight happens.

**Table expectation:** Your turn should be decisive. If you exceed the shot-clock, default to a basic chain hit or a simple reposition (pull/push 1) and lose 1 Personal Hype (or become Shaken if at 0).

## Level 1 Kit

### Starting Kit
Weapon: **Vine Chain**.
**Basic Attack** (1 Action, melee/reach as GM allows): **`1d6` + `Heart`**

**Unique Feature – Reposition Artist (once per round)**
When you land a **Hit+** on any attack, you may **push or pull** the target **2 squares** (your choice). 
If you move the target adjacent to an ally, create a **Tag Window** on the target.
If your reposition forces a target out of **Full Cover** or breaks a formation in an obvious way, gain **+1 Team Hype** (once per round).

`Note: Your signature is “make it hittable.” You set the lane, others cash in.`

**Hype Gain (Personal):** +1 PH for a Named Hit; or when your Tag Window is converted into a Named Hit; or when you clutch-downgrade an attack to Graze/Miss. Max +1 PH per Ranger per round.

**Hype Gain (Team):** +1 TH for Style Chain (2 different Named moves in a round), Mook Sweep (3+ mooks Down in a round), or Objective Win. Max +2 TH per round total.

### Wrestling List
| **Move**                        | **Cost** | **Hype** | **Hit+  Outcome**                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clincher  Grab**              | 1A       | –        | **Grabbed** + **Tag Window**. Damage `1d4` + `Power`.        |
| **Leg Sweep**                   | 1A       | –        | **Prone** + **Exposed** + **Tag Window**. Damage `1d4` + `Agility`. |
| **Irish Whip**                  | 1A       | –        | Push 2; if ends adjacent to ally → **Tag Window**. Damage `1d4` + `Heart`. |
| **Ring-Out  Throw**  **(Team)** | 2A       | 1 TH     | Big push into obstacle; collision chip and reposition. (Terrain matters.) |
| **Human  Catapult**  **(Tag)**  | 1A ea    | 2 TH     | Throw target into a tile; splash damage and ideal clumping  for follow-ups. |

## Level 2 Upgrade
```
Increase max HP by +4.
```
**Stage Direction (once per fight)**
As an Action, choose a target within 6 squares. Make any attack (melee or ranged).
On Hit+: apply **Exposed** and immediately **Reposition Artist** triggers even if you already used it this round. If the target ends adjacent to an ally, also grant that ally **+1 Personal Hype** (PH gain caps still apply). 

### Scale Whip – Weapon Package
At level 2, your ranger grows a deeper affinity for their weapon, allowing them to use special named attacks with it.

| **Move**                           | **Cost**  | **Hype** | **Effect**                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SPOTLIGHT  SNARE**  **Setup**    | 1 Action  | 1 PH     | Damage **`1d4` + `Heart`**.  On Hit+: **Pull 2 squares** and  create/refresh a **Tag Window**. |
| **RING-OUT  WHIPLASH**  **Payoff** | 2 Actions | 1 TH     | Damage **`2d4` + `Heart`**. On Hit+: **Push or Pull 3**. If the target  collides with a wall/obstacle, deal +**`1d4`**  and apply **Prone**. |

## Level 3 – Neon Avatar Unlock
```
Increase max HP by +5.
```

At Level 3 you unlock Neon Avatar specialization. For v0.1, Green’s default is **Kaleidoscopic Hydra**

**Manifest** (Activate): Cost **1 Action** + **1 Personal Hype**. Avatar stays active for the rest of the fight.

### Neon Avatar – Kaleidoscopic Hydra

The Hydra manifests as a multi-headed neon serpent. Each ‘head’ behaves like a tether: you pull, reset, and line targets up so the team can land its biggest Tag finishers.

| **Component**                        | **Rule**                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Passive:**  **Multi-Head  Sync**   | Once per round, when an ally lands a Named Hit, you may  step 1 square. If that step ends adjacent to the target, gain +1 Personal  Hype (PH cap applies). |
| **Basic:**  **Hydra Lash**           | 1 Action, range 6. Damage **`1d6` + `Heart`**. On Hit+: pull 1 square (optional). |
| **Utility:**  **Cue the  Spotlight** | 1 Action, range 3, Team Only. Cost **1 Team Hype**. Choose an ally: upgrade their next attack this round  by 1 step OR grant a Shield Token (max 1). |
| **Named:**  **MANY-HEAD  RESET**     | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Personal Hype**. Damage **`2d4`  + `Heart`**. On Hit+: pull 2 squares, then apply **Prone** + **Tag Window**. |
| **Named:**  **FINAL  STRING-PULL**   | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Team Hype**. Req: target has Tag Window. Damage **`2d6` + `Heart`**. On Hit+: choose **Launch + Prone** OR **Crack Armor**. |

## Green Play Patterns (quick)

- **Drag into the spotlight:** basic chain hit → Reposition Artist pull 2 → target loses cover and gains Tag Window.
- **Make Tag turns trivial:** your priority is adjacency setups, not damage totals.
- **Cash in terrain:** Ring-Out Whiplash into walls and corners; then allies finish with Tag moves.
