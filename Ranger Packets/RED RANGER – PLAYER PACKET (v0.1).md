## How you play Red

Red wins fights by **making the target vulnerable** (Exposed/Tag Windows), then **converting that setup** into Armor Cracks for the team. You are the “gap filler”: step into danger when Blue/Pink need space, and call the timing for Tag moves.

**Table expectation:** You call out your named attacks. If you freeze or exceed the shot-clock, your turn defaults to a basic attack or cover move and you lose 1 Personal Hype (or become Shaken if at 0).

## Level 1 Kit

### Starting Kit
Weapon: **Solar Saber**.
**Basic Attack** (1 Action, melee): **`1d6` + Power**

**Unique Feature – Captain’s Cue (once per round)**
When you land a **Hit+** on any attack, choose one:
- **Mark the target:** the target gains **Exposed** and a **Tag Window**.
- **Call the play:** an ally within 3 squares upgrades their next attack this round by 1 step (Miss→Graze→Hit→Crit).

`Note: You are either setting the combo, or ensuring the combo lands.`

**Hype Gain (Personal):** +1 PH for a Named Hit; or when your Tag Window is converted into a Named Hit; or when you clutch-downgrade an attack to Graze/Miss. Max +1 PH per Ranger per round.

**Hype Gain (Team):** +1 TH for Style Chain (2 different Named moves in a round), Mook Sweep (3+ mooks Down in a round), or Objective Win. Max +2 TH per round total.

### Wrestling List

## Level 2 Upgrade
```
Increase max HP by +5.
```

**Rally Protocol (once per fight)**
As an Action, choose up to 3 allies within 3 squares. Each chosen ally removes **Shaken** (if present). Then gain **+1 Team Hype** (still respects the +2 Team Hype per round gain cap). 

### Solar Saber – Weapon Package
At level 2, your ranger grows a deeper affinity for their weapon, allowing them to use special named attacks with it.

| **Move**                        | **Cost**  | **Hype** | **Effect**                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SOLAR MARK SLASH**  **Setup** | 2 Actions | 1 PH     | Damage **2d4 + Power**. On Hit+: **Exposed**  + **Tag Window**. On Crit: +1 die and **Crack Armor** (Lieutenant/Boss only). |
| **HELIOS CLEAVE**  **Finisher** | 2 Actions | 1 TH     | Damage **2d6 + Power** to main target; a second adjacent target takes **Graze** damage. On Hit+: **Crack Armor** (Lieutenant/Boss). |

## Level 3 – Neon Avatar Unlock
```
Increase max HP by +5.
```

At Level 3 you unlock a Neon Avatar. For v0.1, Red’s default is **Hyper Light Unicorn**.

**Manifest** (Activate): Cost **1 Action** + **1 Personal Hype**. Avatar stays active for the rest of the fight.

### Neon Avatar – Hyper Light Unicorn

The Unicorn manifests as a luminous myth-beast that turns Red into a dependable protector while still enabling combo play.

| **Component**                       | **Rule**                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| **Basic:**  **Horn Bash**           | 1 Action, melee. Damage **1d6 + Power**. On Hit+: push 1 square. |
| **Utility:**  **Aegis Mane**        | 1 Action, range 3, Team  Only. Cost **1 Team Hype**. Grant ally  Half Cover until your next turn and a Shield Token (max 1). |
| **Named:**  **LUMINOUS LANCE LOCK** | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Personal Hype**. Damage **2d4  + Power**. On Hit+: Grabbed + Tag Window. |
| **Named:**  **ROYAL COMET VERDICT** | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Team Hype**. Req: target  Grabbed/Prone. Damage **2d6 + Power**.  On Hit+: Launch (push 3) + Prone. On Crit: +1 die and Crack Armor  (Lieutenant/Boss). |

## Red Play Patterns (quick)

- **Setup then crack:** Captain’s Cue (Mark) → Solar Mark Slash → Hot Tag Clothesline.
- **Protect the engine:** stay near Blue/Pink, use Aegis Mane on allies who are about to take a big hit.
- **Close fights:** if the target is Prone/Grabbed, cash in with Royal Comet Verdict or Contract Termination.
