## How you play Black

Black wins fights by **being the problem**: you step into the lane, grab the dangerous target, and keep it pinned so the team can pose, build Hype, and land Tag finishers. You are the party’s **anchor**: you absorb chip damage and deny enemy movement.

**Table expectation:** You should be decisive and physical. If you exceed the shot-clock, default to a basic hit or Clincher Grab and lose 1 Personal Hype (or become Shaken if at 0).

## Level 1 Kit

### Starting Kit
Weapon: **Obsidian Gauntlets**
**Basic Attack** (1 Action, melee): `2d4` + `Power`

**Unique Feature – Iron Clinch (once per round)**
When you land a **Hit+** with a melee attack, you may immediately apply one:

- **Grabbed** (target can’t freely reposition; Tag Window created).
- **Staggered** (target is off-balance; Tag Window created).

If the target is a Lieutenant/Boss, you may apply these only after at least **1 Armor Token** is cracked (boss-control rule).

**Hype Gain (Personal):** +1 PH for a Named Hit; or when your Tag Window is converted into a Named Hit; or when you clutch-downgrade an attack to Graze/Miss. Max +1 PH per Ranger per round.

**Hype Gain (Team):** +1 TH for Style Chain (2 different Named moves in a round), Mook Sweep (3+ mooks Down in a round), or Objective Win. Max +2 TH per round total.

### Wrestling List

## Level 2 Upgrade
```
Increase max HP by +6.
```

**Unbreakable (once per fight)**
When you would take a **Crit**, you may downgrade it to a **Hit**. If you do, gain **+1 Personal Hype** (PH cap applies).

### Obsidian Gauntlets – Weapon Package
At level 2, your ranger grows a deeper affinity for their weapon, allowing them to use special named attacks with it.

| **Move**                            | **Cost**  | **Hype** | **Effect**                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **RUT-CHARGE  GRAB**  **Setup**     | 1 Action  | 1 PH     | Damage **`1d4` + Power**.  On Hit+: **Grabbed** + **Tag Window**. If already Grabbed,  instead apply **Prone**. |
| **OBSIDIAN  POWERBOMB**  **Payoff** | 2 Actions | 1 TH     | Damage **`2d6` + Power**.  Req: target Grabbed/Prone. On Hit+: **Launch  (push 3)** + **Prone**. On Crit: +1  die and **Crack Armor** (Lt/Boss). |


## Level 3 – Neon Avatar Unlock
```
Increase max HP by +6.
```

At Level 3 you unlock Neon Avatar specialization. For v0.1, Black’s default is **Blacklight Minotaur**

**Manifest** (Activate): Cost **1 Action** + **1 Personal Hype**. Avatar stays active for the rest of the fight.


### Neon Avatar – Blacklight Minotaur

The Minotaur manifests as a neon brute within a glowing labyrinth. It turns Black into a true frontliner: lock targets down, protect allies with cover and shields, and slam enemies into the grid.

| **Component**                        | **Rule**                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Passive:**  **Iron  Labyrinth**    | Once per round, when you downgrade an incoming attack  (Shield Token, PR Spin, Intercept, etc.), gain +1 Personal Hype (PH cap  applies). |
| **Basic:**  **Horn-and-Fist**        | 1 Action, melee. Damage **`1d6` + `Power`**. On Hit+: push 1 square. |
| **Utility:**  **Labyrinth  Wall**    | 1 Action, range 3, Team Only. Cost **1 Team Hype**. Grant ally Half Cover until your next turn and a  `Shield Token` (max 1). |
| **Named:**  **LABYRINTH  LOCK**      | 2 Actions  (All-Out), cost **1 Personal Hype**.  Damage **2d4 + Power**. On Hit+: **Grabbed** + **Tag Window**. |
| **Named:**  **BULL  KING’S VERDICT** | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Team Hype**. Req: target Grabbed/Prone. Damage **`2d6` + `Power`**. On Hit+: Launch (push 3)  + Prone. On Crit: +1 die and Crack Armor (Lieutenant/Boss). |

## Black Play Patterns (quick)

- **Anchor the lane:** walk into threat range; Iron Clinch → Grabbed/Staggered → Tag Window for allies.
- **Survive spikes:** Unbreakable downgrades Crits; use it when the boss tries to delete you.
- **Cash in:** Obsidian Powerbomb / Bull King’s Verdict when the target is Grabbed/Prone; then let allies finish.
