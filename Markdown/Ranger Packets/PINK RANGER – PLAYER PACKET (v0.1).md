## How you play Pink

Pink wins fights by **keeping the engine online**: you stabilize allies with shields, smooth out bad rolls, and generate **Team Hype** so the party can actually afford Tag finishers. Your damage is secondary; your real job is **making everyone else better** while still feeling like a hero on-screen.

**Table expectation:** You should be fast and supportive. If you exceed the shot-clock, default to a basic attack or a shield grant and lose 1 Personal Hype (or become Shaken if at 0).

## Level 1 Kit

### Starting Kit
Weapon: **Starlight Bow**.
**Basic Attack** (1 Action, ranged): **`1d6` + `Tech`**

**Unique Feature – Spotlight Buffer (once per round)**
When an ally within 3 squares is targeted by an attack, you may spend **1 Personal Hype** to do one:
- **Shield:** grant that ally a **Shield Token** (max 1).
- **Spin:** downgrade the incoming result by **1 step** (Crit→Hit→Graze→Miss). If this prevents a Crit, gain **+1 Team Hype** (subject to +2 TH/round cap).

`Note: This is what makes fights feel like an episode: dramatic saves and perfect timing.`

**Hype Gain (Personal):** +1 PH for a Named Hit; or when your support enables a Named Hit; or when you clutch-downgrade an attack to Graze/Miss. Max +1 PH per Ranger per round.

**Hype Gain (Team):** +1 TH for Style Chain, Mook Sweep, Objective Win, and for preventing a Crit with Spotlight Buffer (cap applies). Max +2 TH per round total.

### Wrestling List
| **Move**                             | **Cost** | **Hype** | **Hit+  Outcome**                                            |

| **Harmonic  Rescue**  **(Team)**     | 2A       | 1 TH     | Choose an ally: remove Shaken and grant a `Shield Token` (max  1). Then you may step 2 squares. |
| **Friendship  Finale**  **(Tag)**    | 1A ea    | 2 TH     | Damage `2d4` + `Heart` and grant 1 `Shield Token` to both Rangers  in the Tag move (max 1 each). |

## Level 2 Upgrade
```

```

**Morale Surge (once per fight)**
As an Action, choose up to 3 allies within 3 squares. Each chosen ally may either (a) remove **Shaken**, or (b) gain **+1 Personal Hype** (cannot exceed their max). Then gain **+1 Team Hype** (cap applies). 

### Starlight Bow – Weapon Package
At level 2, your ranger grows a deeper affinity for their weapon, allowing them to use special named attacks with it.

| **Move**                              | **Cost**  | **Hype** | **Effect**                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **BRANDED  STRIKE SHOT**  **Support** | 1 Action  | 1 PH     | Make a ranged attack. Upgrade the result by **1 step** (Miss→Graze→Hit→Crit).  Damage **`2d4` + `Tech`**. |
| **HEARTBEAT  VOLLEY**  **Payoff**     | 2 Actions | 1 TH     | Damage **`2d4` + `Tech`**.  On Hit+: choose one ally within 3 squares:  they gain a **`Shield  Token`** (max 1) OR remove **Shaken**. |

## Level 3 – Neon Avatar Unlock
```
Increase max HP by +5.
```

At Level 3 you unlock Neon Avatar specialization. For v0.1, Pink’s default is **Phoenix Luminary**

**Manifest** (Activate): Cost **1 Action** + **1 Personal Hype**. Avatar stays active for the rest of the fight.

### Neon Avatar – Phoenix Luminary

The Phoenix manifests as a radiant neon bird of rebirth. It turns Pink into the team’s true support lead: shields become stronger, morale surges become frequent, and the party survives swingy turns without slowing play.

| **Component**                     | **Rule**                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Passive:**  **Ashes-to-Spark**  | Once per round, when you grant a Shield Token, also remove **Shaken** from that ally (if present).  If they were not Shaken, gain +1 Team Hype (cap applies). |
| **Basic:**  **Ember Shot**        | 1 Action, ranged. Damage **`1d6` + `Tech`**. On Hit+: choose ally within 3: they gain a Shield  Token (max 1). |
| **Utility:**  **Wings of  Cover** | 1 Action, range 3, Team Only. Cost **1 Team Hype**. Grant ally Half Cover until your next turn and a  Shield Token (max 1). |
| **Named:**  **RISING  CHORUS**    | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Personal Hype**. Damage **`2d4`  + `Heart`**. On Hit+: grant Shield Token to two allies (max 1 each). |
| **Named:**  **PHOENIX  OVERTURE** | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **2 Team Hype**. Damage **`2d6` +  `Heart`**. On Hit+: remove Shaken from all allies within 3; then grant 1  Shield Token to one ally (max 1). |

## Pink Play Patterns (quick)

- **Prevent spikes:** Spotlight Buffer (Spin) on big hits; convert ‘almost disasters’ into Team Hype.
- **Fund finishers:** Stereo Finisher Pose + Morale Surge → keep Team Hype available for Tag moves.
- **Support without stalling:** Heartbeat Volley and Phoenix Overture stabilize while still doing damage.
