## How you play Blue

Blue wins fights by **controlling sightlines**, applying **Exposed** and **Tag Windows** at range, and delivering consistent **Armor Cracks** when the team needs to break a boss open. You are the team’s **precision engine**: you make the scary target hittable from across the map.

**Table expectation:** You are the ‘caller’ for ranges and cover. If you exceed the shot-clock, your turn defaults to a basic shot or a marked target action and you lose 1 Personal Hype (or become Shaken if at 0).

## Level 1 Kit

### Starting Kit
Weapon: **Glacier Blaster**
**Basic Attack** (1 Action, ranged): **`1d6` + `Tech`**

**Unique Feature – Target Painter (once per round)** When you land a **Hit+** with a ranged attack, choose one:
- **Expose:** target becomes **Exposed**.
- **Tag it:** target gains a **Tag Window**.

If the target already has one of these, you may apply the other instead.

`Note: Blue’s job is reliability: set the condition, then let the team cash it in.`

**Hype Gain (Personal):** +1 PH for a Named Hit; or when your Exposed/Tag Window is converted into a Named Hit; or when you clutch-downgrade an attack to Graze/Miss. Max +1 PH per Ranger per round.

**Hype Gain (Team):** +1 TH for Style Chain (2 different Named moves in a round), Mook Sweep (3+ mooks Down in a round), or Objective Win. Max +2 TH per round total.

### Wrestling List

| **Move**                              | **Cost** | **Hype** | **Hit+  Outcome**                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Leg Sweep**                         | 1A       | –        | If forced into melee: **Prone**  + **Exposed** + **Tag Window**. Damage `1d4`  + `Agility`. |
| **Irish Whip**                        | 1A       | –        | Push 2; if ends adjacent to ally → **Tag Window**. Damage `1d4` + `Heart`. |
| **Rope-a-Dope**                       | 1A       | –        | **Shaken**. If  already Shaken: also Tag Window. Damage `1d4` + `Heart`. |
| **One-Two  Justice Combo**  **(Tag)** | 1A ea    | 1 TH     | Reliable Tag hit: upgrade this Tag move’s result by 1 step.  Damage `2d4` + highest `Power`. |
| **Stereo  Finisher Pose**  **(Tag)**  | 1A ea    | 1 TH     | No damage: +2 Team Hype (cap applies) and upgrade next ally  attack by 1 step. |

## Level 2 Upgrade
```
Increase max HP by +3.
```
**Overwatch Protocol (once per fight)**
Spend 1 Action to **Ready** a ranged shot: “If an enemy enters line of sight or is Launched into view, I fire.” When it triggers, your shot upgrades by **1 step** (Miss→Graze→Hit→Crit). 

### Glacier Blaster – Weapon Package
At level 2, your ranger grows a deeper affinity for their weapon, allowing them to use special named attacks with it.

| **Move**                                  | **Cost**  | **Hype** | **Effect**                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GLACIER  MARKER**  **ROUND**  **Setup** | 1 Action  | 1 PH     | Damage **`1d4` + `Tech`**.  On Hit+: **Exposed** + **Tag Window**. |
| **ZERO-LINE  RAILSHOT**  **Payoff**       | 2 Actions | 1 TH     | Damage **`2d4` + `Tech`**.  Ignores **Half Cover**. On Hit+: **Crack Armor** (Lieutenant/Boss). On  Crit: +1 die and target becomes **Shaken**. |

## Level 3 – Neon Avatar Unlock
```
Increase max HP by +3.
```
At Level 3 you unlock Neon Avatar specialization. For v0.1, Blue’s default is **Hoarfrost Bomber Cyclops**.

**Manifest** (Activate): Cost **1 Action** + **1 Personal Hype**. Avatar stays active for the rest of the fight.


### Neon Avatar – Hoarfrost Bomber Cyclops

The Cyclops manifests as a neon giant with a single focusing eye. It turns Blue into the team’s long-range finisher: mark the target, ignore cover, and crack armor on demand.

| **Component**                        | **Rule**                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Passive:**  **Targeting  Overlay** | Once per  round, when you apply **Exposed**,  gain +1 Team Hype (subject to +2 TH/round cap). |
| **Basic:**  **One-Eye  Burst**       | 1 Action, ranged. Damage **`1d6` + `Tech`**. If you did not Move this turn, ignore **Half Cover**. |
| **Utility:**  **Gaze Lock**          | 1 Action, range 8. Cost **1 Personal Hype**. No damage. On Hit+: **Exposed** + **Tag Window**. |
| **Named:**  **SUB-ZERO FREEZE**   | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Personal Hype**. Damage **`2d4`  + `Tech`**. On Hit+: **Shaken** + **Exposed**. |
| **Named:**  **SUNDERBEAM**           | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **2 Team Hype**. Damage **`2d6` +  `Tech`**. On Hit+: **Crack Armor**. On  Crit: +1 die and target becomes **Prone**  (if eligible). |

## Blue Play Patterns (quick)

- **Open with setup:** Glacier Marker Round / Target Painter → Exposed + Tag Window for the team.
- **Hold lanes:** Overwatch Protocol triggers when enemies get Launched into view or step out of cover.
- **Break bosses:** Zero-Line Railshot early; Cyclops Sunderbeam when the team needs a decisive Armor Crack.
