## How you play Yellow

Yellow wins fights by **getting there first**, creating **Prone** and **Tag Windows**, then sliding into the next setup before enemies can reset. You are the team’s **tempo engine**: if you’re doing your job, the party is constantly cashing in Tag moves.

**Table expectation:** You call out your named attacks fast. If you exceed the shot-clock, your turn defaults to a basic attack or a reposition move and you lose 1 Personal Hype (or become Shaken if at 0).

## Level 1 Kit

### Starting Kit
Weapon: **Volt Tonfas**.
Basic Attack (1 Action, melee): `1d6` + `Agility`

Unique Feature – Momentum Step (once per round)
When you land a **Hit+** with a melee attack, you may immediately move **2 squares** (free step). 
If you end this step adjacent to the same target, that target gains a **Tag Window** (or refreshes it).

`Note: This is your identity: hit, reposition, and keep the combo lane open.`

**Hype Gain (Personal):** +1 PH for a Named Hit; or when your Tag Window is converted into a Named Hit; or when you clutch-downgrade an attack to Graze/Miss. Max +1 PH per Ranger per round.

**Hype Gain (Team):** +1 TH for Style Chain (2 different Named moves in a round), Mook Sweep (3+ mooks Down in a round), or Objective Win. Max +2 TH per round total.

### Wrestling List

| **Move**                              | **Cost** | **Hype** | **Hit+  Outcome**                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Leg Sweep**                         | 1A       | –        | **Prone** + **Exposed** + **Tag Window**. Damage `1d4` + `Agility`. |
| **Irish Whip**                        | 1A       | –        | Push 2; if ends adjacent to ally → **Tag Window**. Damage `1d4` + `Heart`. |
| **Powerbomb  Protocol**               | 2A       | 1        | Launch (push 3) + Prone. Damage `2d4` + `Power`.             |
| **Alley-Oop  Suplex**  **(Tag)**      | 1A ea    | 2 TH     | Launch + Prone. Damage `2d4` + `2`.                          |
| **One-Two  Justice Combo**  **(Tag)** | 1A ea    | 1 TH     | Reliable hit: upgrade this Tag move’s result by 1 step.  Damage `2d4` + highest `Power`. |


## Level 2 Upgrade
```
Increase max HP by +4.
```

**Rapid Reset (once per fight)**
When you would become **Shaken** or **Prone**, you may ignore it and instead move **2 squares**. If you move adjacent to any enemy, gain **+1 Personal Hype** (still obeys PH gain cap). 

### Volt Tonfas – Weapon Package
At level 2, your ranger grows a deeper affinity for their weapon, allowing them to use special named attacks with it.

| **Move**                            | **Cost**  | **Hype**  | **Effect**                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **VOLT TRIP  COMBO**  **Setup**     | 1 Action  | 1 PH      | Damage **`1d4` + `Agility`**.  On Hit+: **Prone** + **Tag Window**. Then you may move **2 squares** (no provoke). |
| **FLASHSTEP  FINISHER**  **Payoff** | 2 Actions | 1 (PH/TH) | Damage **`2d4` + `Agility`**.  On Hit+: upgrade your result by **1 step**  (Miss→Graze→Hit→Crit). On  Crit: +1 die. |

## Level 3 – Neon Avatar Unlock
```
Increase max HP by +4.
```
At Level 3 you unlock Neon Avatar specialization. For v0.1, Yellow’s default is **Griffin Choreographer**.

**Manifest** (Activate): Cost **1 Action** + **1 Personal Hype**. Avatar stays active for the rest of the fight.

### Neon Avatar – Griffin Choreographer

The Griffin manifests as an aerial neon beast that ‘directs’ the fight: hooks, pulls, and sudden knockdowns that turn the battlefield into a combo lane.

| **Component**                        | **Rule**                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Passive:**  **Wingbeat  Timing**   | Once per round, when an ally lands a Named Hit, you may  move 1 square for free. If you end adjacent to that target, gain +1 Personal  Hype (PH cap applies). |
| **Basic:**  **Talon Line**           | 1 Action, range 6 (or melee). Damage **`1d6` + `Heart`**. On Hit+: pull 1 square (optional). |
| **Utility:**  **High-Flight  Cue**   | 1 Action, range 3, Team Only. Cost **1 Team Hype**. Choose an ally: upgrade their next attack this round  by 1 step OR grant a Shield Token (max 1). |
| **Named:**  **SKYHOOK  RESET**       | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Personal Hype**. Damage **`2d4`  + `Heart`**. On Hit+: pull 2 squares, then apply **Prone** + **Tag Window**. |
| **Named:**  **DIVING  CURTAIN CALL** | 2 Actions (All-Out), cost **1 Team Hype**. Req: target has Tag Window. Damage **`2d6` + `Heart`**. On Hit+: choose **Launch + Prone** OR **Crack Armor**. |

## Yellow Play Patterns (quick)

- **Open the lane:** Volt Trip Combo → free 2-square move → set the Tag Window where the team can use it.

- **Keep momentum:** Momentum Step triggers on Hit+; reposition to threaten the next target immediately. • **Cash in:** when TH is available, enable Alley-Oop / Justice Combo; when you need reliability, Flashstep Finisher upgrades its own result.
