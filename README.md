# ⚡🦄🔥 *Neon Beasts* — Campaign Overview

*A limited tokusatsu workplace satire (10–12 episodes). Maximum cheese. Played dead straight.*

In **Lumenport**, heroism isn’t a calling — it’s a **licensed industry**. Every crisis is a deliverable, every fight is a branded performance, and every “act of courage” is scored, monetized, and audited.

Three forces collide every week:

1. a washed-up **legacy Ranger team** trying to earn back its name,
2. a sleek holding company that treats public safety like a portfolio,
3. and a volcano lair villain org that’s still running on **1987 logic** — sincerely.

## 🌈 1) The Heroes: **Legacy Guardian Corps (LGC)**

### 🎬 The vibe

They were *the* Rangers. The theme song charted. The merch was everywhere. Their old footage still gets clipped on nostalgia channels.

Now it’s 2026 and LGC is a **low-tier branch** assigned to “quiet incidents” nobody wants on the timeline: gutter slimes, nuisance beasts, minor cult weirdness, and “please resolve off-camera if possible.”

But they still suit up like it matters — and it does.

### 🧾 The hook

LGC is heroism with a **timecard**. The team clocks in, gets sent to embarrassing jobs, fights in bright spandex sincerity, then returns to base to do:

* incident reports
* brand compliance
* sponsor “auditions”
* mandatory training
* and a debrief where someone gets roasted for mispronouncing their finisher name

### 🧠 In-universe rules (cartoon logic enforced like policy)

* **You don’t die.** If you get wrecked, you “reform” back at base after the scene (it’s just how Ranger tech works here).
* **Named attacks matter.** If you don’t call it out, it still “works,” but it doesn’t count as a *branded action* (and it won’t juice the hype the same way).
* **Escalations require authorization.** Zords, mega-forms, threat tiers — all classified by corporate procedure and budget.

### 🦄🐦🐂🐉👁️🦅 The team identity: **Neon Beasts**

LGC’s modern “revival” theme is **Greek/Persian myth creatures, reimagined as neon avatar archetypes**, because nostalgia sells — and because it gives clean zord logic later.

* **Red:** Unicorn (leader / “ideal hero” brand icon)
* **Blue:** Cyclops (precision / beam-tech / ranged specialist)
* **Yellow:** Griffin (mobility / striker / aerial flair)
* **Green:** Hydra (control / reposition / many-angle problem solver)
* **Black:** Minotaur (tank / anchor / frontline)
* **Pink:** Phoenix (support / morale / shields / clutch saves)

At each level, the Rangers get a unique power up, first they unlock the true power of their weapons, and then at Level 3, they get their NEON AVATAR Package.

### 📉 The underdog engine

LGC is a legacy IP that fell off because they never adapted to the influencer era, modern branding, or the “attention economy.” They’ve got history — but history doesn’t pay salaries.

Their base still looks like it peaked in the 80s. Their CEO is a well-meaning fossil kept around as the “face,” while the real decisions happen above him.

### ✅ What “winning” looks like (season spine)

LGC is on a probationary “comeback or liquidation” track. If they can hit a **rigged performance benchmark** by end-of-quarter, they unlock a chance to **buy themselves back** and regain autonomy.

The catch? The metric is a composite score that can be quietly manipulated.
So the Rangers have to win fights *and* win the system.

## 🧊 2) The Weekly Villains: **Caldera Dynamics (Volcano HQ)**

### 🌋 The vibe

Caldera is classic monster-of-the-week evil… run like a company. Their HQ is literally under an active volcano. There’s a parking lot outside. There are visitor badges. There are lava safety drills.

They’re equal parts **inspirational and theatrical**, but they’re also deeply behind the times.

### 🏢 What Caldera is

A sincere villain org that still believes world domination is achieved by:

* planting flags on landmarks
* issuing dramatic ultimatums
* unveiling a monster like a product launch
* “humiliating the heroes” in front of an audience
* and respecting the sacred tradition of the monologue 🎤

They are not cowards. They are not secretly good.
They are just… operating like it’s still 1987.

### 🧯 The punchline that becomes real conflict

Caldera’s employee culture is weirdly decent — solid benefits, supportive HR, lots of “we’re a family” energy — which makes the Rangers occasionally think:

> “Wait… why do the bad guys have better healthcare than us?”

Caldera *could* win instantly if they modernized. But they refuse. They haven’t “sold out.”
Their incompetence is ideological.

### 🧨 The long arc: the DOOM ENGINE

They’re building a ridiculous ultimate device — the **DOOM ENGINE** — but it keeps getting delayed by:

* rehearsals and pageantry
* procurement issues
* craftsmanship debates
* “we can’t ship menace until it passes internal review”

It’s the most sincere bureaucracy in the world.

### 🎯 What “winning” looks like for Caldera

Symbolic victories. Dramatic humiliation. Incremental progress on a giant dumb endgame.
And having their Princess-class lieutenant look cool doing it.

## 🛡️ 3) The Real Antagonist: **Aegis Portfolio Group**

### 🧊 The vibe

Aegis is the villain you can’t punch: calm voices, perfect slides, friendly tone that feels like a threat.

Their tagline is clean enough to be on a billboard:

**“Protection Is Our Business.”**

Subtext: if you don’t perform heroism in the approved profitable way, you don’t deserve to exist.

### 📦 What Aegis actually is

A holding company that owns “protection” end-to-end:

* Ranger brands (tiered franchises)
* cleanup / reconstruction contractors
* insurance influence and claims pipelines
* media distribution and highlight reels
* licensing, merch, catchphrase ownership
* talent management (Rangers treated like idol acts)

Aegis profits whether the Rangers win or lose — as long as the cycle continues.

### 🔧 How Aegis causes conflict

Aegis nudges reality toward revenue:

* pressures spectacle because it sells
* rewards “marketable heroism” and punishes “unbranded conduct”
* makes approvals slow and humiliating
* weaponizes the benchmark score that decides if LGC lives or dies
* turns collateral damage into “growth opportunities” via subsidiaries

They’re not evil like cartoon villains. They’re evil like modern success.

### 🧾 What “winning” looks like for Aegis

Either LGC becomes a standardized profitable franchise…
or the people get liquidated and the IP lives forever.

## ⚡ The Three-Way Engine (why every episode works)

All three factions chase the same fuel: **Hype / Engagement Energy** 🔥

* **LGC** needs it to survive the quarter and earn back independence.
* **Aegis** converts it into valuation and control.
* **Caldera** generates it through spectacle, believing attention = dominance.

The joke is that the volcano villains aren’t the true danger.
The quarterly review is.

---

## 📺 What an episode looks like (10–12 episode cadence)

1. LGC clocks in for a humiliating assignment (low-tier incident, low budget).
2. Caldera launches a themed crisis with a Princess and/or Monster-class lieutenant.
3. Rangers suit up, pose, shout moves, fight it straight — sometimes get obliterated and reform.
4. The win creates consequences: cleanup costs, PR fallout, KPI penalties.
5. Aegis drops a memo that sounds reasonable and makes everything worse.
6. Stinger: DOOM ENGINE progress or Aegis tightening the leash.

---

## 🧩 Season spine (the buyback arc)

LGC learns the truth: Aegis didn’t buy them to save them.
Aegis bought them to monetize nostalgia and control the protection market.

The Rangers’ only path out is to:

* beat the rigged system at its own metrics 📈
* expose the manipulation 🕵️
* and keep being real heroes even when it doesn’t trend

Meanwhile Caldera keeps showing up with heartfelt speeches and inefficient evil plans, accidentally becoming the most consistent part of the Rangers’ week.

## 🎭 Tone statement (for the repo / trailer blurb)

Bright. Dramatic. Sincere.
The monsters are ridiculous, the poses are mandatory, the stakes are corporate, and the most terrifying thing in the world is a quarterly performance review. 😄📊
